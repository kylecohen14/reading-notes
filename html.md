##### HTML basics
- HTML is the structure of a web page.
 - using tags like ``` <p> ``` is a way to start elements
 - Using ``` </p> ``` would close
- so the **content** would be inbetween the opening and closing tag.
- The tags and the content inbetween all together makes the element.

- Attributes are a way to label elements with a identifier
 - This is done using a space betweem the attribute and the element name like so
 ``` <p class="editor-note">```Content ```</p>```
