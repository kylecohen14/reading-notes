# React and forms
## Forms
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  - Input form element whose value is controlled by react
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
  - update as the user types. Able to pass to other UI elements or reset it from othe event handlers
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  - add a name attribute

## Conditional ternary operator
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
 

```   if(x===y){ ```
 ``` console.log(true); ```
 ``` } else { ```
``` console.log(false); ```
 ``` } ```
 ``` x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false) ```
