# State and Props

1. Render
2. Constructer in the mounting phase
3. render, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, constructor, reactUpdates
4. Used after component is mounted. Used if anything needs to use network request or starting the DOM

1. anything to pass to function (components). What you want to render from components. Or display something to user with title and subtitle
2. Props pass thorugh to component (outside of component), state happens inside the component
3. State will re render the app, props need to be rendered outside of component
4. stores the thing that we are updating. Like storign a counter.

- **props render, state stores**
