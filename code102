### Essientally wireframing is laying out or drafting what you want the end product to look like.

##### HTML basics
- HTML is the structure of a web page.
 - using tags like ``` <p> ``` is a way to start elements
 - Using ``` </p> ``` would close
- so the **content** would be inbetween the opening and closing tag.
- The tags and the content inbetween all together makes the element.

- Attributes are a way to label elements with a identifier
 - This is done using a space betweem the attribute and the element name like so
 ``` <p class="editor-note">```Content ```</p>```

Things like images included into code might be "empty"

# Lists
Sometimes you may need to create a list.
To do so start with an ``` <ul> ``` element for unordered list.
Ordered list will need ``` <ol> ````
Each item on said list should be inside of a ``` <li> ``` to let the system know that that is indeed the lsit item.
 - For example
 ``` <p>Grocery list</p> ```
 ``` <ul> ```
    ``` <li>milk</li> ```
``` </ul> ```

### Links
To add a link....
    - First you will need an anchor
        ``` <a> ```
    - Add a "href" attribute
        ``` <a href=""></a> ```
    - Fill in the rest with a link
        ``` <a href="https://www.cats.org/en/"></a> ```


##### Semantics

- Semantics = meaning
Or basically the effect code has

- Semantics should make you ask yourself what certian elements will do what, and furthermore, is that going to be the right element for the job.
