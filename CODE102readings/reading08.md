- ## Operators
- Binary and unary operators in JS

- **Assignment operators** use = to assign a value to the left operand based on the value of the right

#### Loops
Easy way to do something repeatedly
- ## *For* loop repeats until a condition evaulates to false.
- *do...while* repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false
-  ## *while* statement executes its statements as long as specified condition evaulates to true
IF false the loop stops and passes the statemnet following the loop
- *labeled* statement with an identifier lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program
- *Break* statement to terminate a loop, switch or in conjunction with a labeled statement
- *Continue* statement can be used to restart a *while* , *do-while* , *for* , *label*
