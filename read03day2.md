## Version Control allows you to revisit diffrent versions of a file/files by recording changes

- Centralized VC
collaboration with a team

- Distributed version Control (**DVCS)**
Creates mirrored repos to prevent work being lost incase **CVS** goes down


## What is GIT
- Snapshots
Its a DVCS, stores data in a file made up of snapshots.

Every time you "commit" git creats a snapshot, and stores a reference

- Local operations
Git relies mostly on local.

## Changes
Every change applied to any fiel or directory is tracked by GIT
## Loss of Data
Git makes it hard to damage files

## States of files
Stages are 
- **Committed**
- **Modified**
- **Staged**

### Setting up a Git Repository
- _** Importing**_
  - Switch to the target project directory
 cd test
  - Use git init command
 git init
 
 ## To track these repo files
 git add * .c
