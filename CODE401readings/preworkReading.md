 ## Learning topic summarized:
  - When given a problem in an interview, programmers make common mistakes. One of the big ones is improper allocation of time.
  - Dont start by diving in and writing code. Think the problem out, lay it out, and vision it first. Think ahead.
    - Read the problem over twice
    - Write out the problems in comments. Then go through and replace the commented problems with solutions
  - Big key to making sure that following the template on how to solve algorithm type problems is having confidence.

  - We are all going to die soon, so why waste our time on pointless stuff that does not benefit anyone including ourselves!
  - Time has value, and most do not value their own time. What I gathered from the readings is that getting a mindset that your time is the most valuable (pretend you make 1000$/hr) so that you can be the most productive.
    - Act like time is money and budget it!
  - Procrastination, busyness, and stress are the enemy!

  - The best way to problem solving is to...
    - Have a frame work
    - Practicing it
  - Steps to follow when approaching a new problem
    - Understand
    - Plan
    - Divide
    - If you get stuck thats okay. Use it to your advantage
    - Pratice

  - THe 5 whys
  - The 5 whys is best when the solutions come from those who have the hands on experience. When a problem happens ask why 5 times. We are looking for counter-measures not solutions actually. Counter measures are going to prevent the problem from recurring
  #### How to use the 5 whys
  - Assemble a team
    - Gather People familiar with the problem
  - Define problem
  - Ask why 5 times
    - Break it down
      - Why does A not work (because of b)
      - Why dosnt b work (because of c)
      - Why dosnt c work (because of the way it was created)
      - Why was it created that way
      - Why is it not done like this
  - Know when to stop (stop asking why when there is no more reasons beyond what has been found)
  - Address the root causes
  - Monitor your measures

### The 5 whys help dig into the problem and help find a counter measure

---
### Event loop
- Event loop is often used to demo how a program or piece of it works. 
---
### Super Mario
- This effect is used to take a form of "failure" and using it in a positive way.
