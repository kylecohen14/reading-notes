##### This is my reading notes for Code Fellows
#### My name is Kyle Cohen
I am currently looking to change careers from HVAC to software development.
To me this is a heavy crash course with minimal experience. 

## I enjoy
**Fishing**
**Hiking**
**My dog**

To me, growth mindset is about the willingness to learn. Reminders for myself include:

- *Want to learn*
- Ask questions even when you "dont want to be that person"
- Utilizing time *effeciently*
