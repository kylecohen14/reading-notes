## Decisions
- Sometimes descisions are made to determine which lines of code should run next. First an expression is evakuated which gives a value. and then a conditinal statement says what to do in that situation.

- A condition tells the system what to do in a particular instance. Like if "the score is less than 50 do this"
```(score >= pass)``` score and pass are **operands** and >= is the operator
- **If** statments evaluates a condition If the anwser comes out to true than the next action is executed
- **else** statments will give an option if the condition comes out to false.
