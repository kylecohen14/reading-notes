## State & Props
- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
- Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
- What does componentDidMount do?
- The render
- Mounting
-  constructor, render, componentDidMount, render, React Updates, componentWillUnmount
- Componentdid mount is invoked right after a component is mounted, put here anything using a network request or initialize the dom


 - What types of things can you pass in the props?
- What is the big difference between props and state?
- When do we re-render our application?
- What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
- anything to pass to function (components). What you want to render from components. Or display something to user with title and subtitle
- Props pass thorugh to component (outside of component), state happens inside the component
- State will re render the app, props need to be rendered outside of component
- stores the thing that we are updating. Like storign a counter
