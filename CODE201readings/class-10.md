# Reading 10 debugging
## ch.10 error handling and debugging
- Being able to find error in code is capable with the ability to understand execution context
  - execution context has two stages
  - the **stack**: when statment needs data froma nother function it stacks functions on top of current task
- Using deduction we find errors in code
- Console helps narrow down where to find these errors
- seven diffrent types of errors
  - error (generic), typeerrror, rangeerror, URIerror, Evalerror, Syntaxerror, reference error
- use try, catch, finally statements and give users feedback
  - try the code
  - catch the error message
  - refresh data and page
